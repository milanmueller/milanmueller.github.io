[^1] There is a strong argument to be made for apple hardware being "good" in a number of ways.
Specifically the efficiency of their arm cpus and overall build quality are for sure compelling attributes that I can aknowledge.
What I dislike about apple products is their pricing w.r.t. ram and storage configuration the terrible os and apple's general anti consumer and anti power user stance on virtually everything.

[^2] "modern" as in everything after about 2010.
