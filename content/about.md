# About Me
My name is Milan Müller - as one might have guessed from the domain name ^^. 

I am (as of 08/2025) studying computer science (M.Sc.) at [Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/) (Germany), while also working in IT (currently in systems administation/network stuff).

On this website I write about personal interest (which mostly concern computers in some way) or just random things I need to put into a keyboard so my mind can move onto other things.

[Posts](/posts/) might be in English (when I'm writing about tech stuff) or German (for my random hobbyist psuedo-philisophy hot takes).

I really like brackets, in case you couldn't already tell.
